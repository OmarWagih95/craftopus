It came to me when I started to design and create my own needs to be unique and special made for me with the colors and designs I prefer, then I wanted to make it for my beloved ones and finally asked myself why I open it up to everyone so we can all have our unique stuff! 

I made Craftopus, It stand for Craft and Octopus where that cute octopus uses his magic 8 hands to create and design in every artistic way he can do. ðŸª„</h1>
